Hi, I'm Tim!
============

> I do software development, ML, knowledge graphs and javascript.

You can find my CV [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Lq2hSpeNNbZZ3NU5JJwKWBXmgY9OSS-crOwuwTgqrUg).

Most of the things I make can be found here on my GitHub profile.

I also create educational software development videos on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/TimErmilov) and do livestreams on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/yamalight).

I post a lot of silly things on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yamalight).

And for some reason, I still have a [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/timofey-ermilov/53/b4a/5a7) profile.

In my free time, I enjoy playing video games on [Steam](http://steamcommunity.com/id/yamalight/).
